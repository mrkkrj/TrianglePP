Since there are no Input validation of the data given for triangulation you need to think about this. 
Poly2Tri does not support repeat points within epsilon.

 - If you have a cyclic function that generates random points make sure you don't add the same coordinate twice.
 - If you are given input and aren't sure same point exist twice you need to check for this yourself.
 - Only simple polygons are supported. You may add holes or interior Steiner points
 - Interior holes must not touch other holes, nor touch the polyline boundary
 - Use the library in this order:
  - Initialize CDT with a simple polyline (this defines the constrained edges)
  - Add holes if necessary (also simple polylines)
  - Add Steiner points
  - Triangulate
